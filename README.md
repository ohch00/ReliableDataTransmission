# ReliableDataTransmission

A class project for CS 372 (Introduction to Computer Networks) that mimics the principles of unreliable data transmission (UDT) in a simulated environment.
The assignment came coupled with skeleton code (rdt_main.py, rdt_layer.py, segment.py, unreliable.py) that imitates a send-receive environment with UDT. 
rdt_main.py would call the main functions, segment.py would create the data segments to be transported, and unreliable.py would be the unreliable channels which the data segments pass through.
The rdt_layer.py was to be edited to provide reliable transportation for data through unreliable channels.
